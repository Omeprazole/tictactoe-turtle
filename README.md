# tictactoe-turtle

A tic tac toe game with an unbeatable AI that uses the python turtle module.
The AI player uses the [minimax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax) algorithm.

There are two files.
tictactoe_ui.py handles everything that involves the turtle module: the screen
and the turtles that draw the board, marks, and text.
tictactoe.py handles the overall control of the game and the bot AI. Run this
file, it will import from tictactoe_ui.py.
