# tictactoe-turtle

A Tic tac toe game with an unbeatable AI that uses the python turtle module for
the user interface. The AI player uses the
[minimax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax) algorithm.

There are two files.
* [tictactoe_ui.py](tictactoe_ui.py) handles the user interface using the
turtle module.
* [tictactoe.py](tictactoe.py) handles the overall control of the game and the
bot AI. Run this file.

Requires Python 3.6+ and tkinter (probably included with python).
