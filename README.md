# tictactoe-turtle

A tic tac toe game with an unbeatable AI that uses the Python turtle module for
the user interface. The AI player uses the
[minimax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax) algorithm.

There are two files.
* [tictactoe_ui.py](tictactoe_ui.py) handles the user interface using the
turtle module.
* [tictactoe.py](tictactoe.py) handles the overall control of the game and the
bot AI.

To run it (after moving into the directory):

    python tictactoe.py

On Windows you may have to use the full path to the Python executable. It works
with both Python 2 and 3.
